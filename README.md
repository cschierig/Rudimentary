# Rudimentary

Slow down the early game when creating a new world by forcing players to gather resources with their hand before
chopping down trees.

Rudimentary adds the following mechanics:

## Flint Tools

Players cannot break logs with their fists, but instead need to gather flint, sticks and flax (obtained by breaking
grass) to craft a flint hatchet. Rudimentary also provides a flint pickaxe.

## Unlit campfires

Campfires are now unlit when placed down. Players can craft fire starters from sticks and flax to ignite them without
having to acquire iron.

## Brick Furnace

A slow blast furnace which requires a bit more work to get than a normal furnace.
It is recommended that you make vanilla furnaces harder to get (e.g.
using [Privileged](https://modrinth.com/mod/privileged)), otherwise brick furnaces don't make much sense.

The brick furnace is accompanied by a new set of brick blocks.

## Dependencies

Rudimentary only depends on Fabric API, but a recipe viewer is recommended.
